# hello-world
Just learning to use this tool
Finally I could edit this file...Another line
But latest changes weren't here for this version! and I create a conflict
Then I resolve it by doing the following steps:
1. from my fork cloned in GitHub for Windows, open the command line
2. typed in "git remote add rocio-bossio git://github.com/rocio-bossio/hello-world.git" ENTER
3. typed in "git pull rocio-bossio master" ENTER
4. closed the command line
5. in GitHub for windows, click on "Show" to expand new section "Uncommited changes" (above history)
6. in Files to commit, right-click on the editor showing the conflict
7. clicked on Open file
8. opened the local file in the editor (Notepad or such)
9. edited the file to remove the conflicted lines and added this text
10. saved the file
11. at the command line again typed in "git add" (to be done after I save this file)
